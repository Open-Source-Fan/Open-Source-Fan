👋 Hello there! I'm an Open-Source-Fan, a first-year B.Tech CSE student at NCU, diving deep into the exciting world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. 

💻 Passionate about coding, I'm constantly exploring new ways to innovate and solve problems. I love working on projects that challenge me to think creatively, whether it's crafting algorithms or building practical applications.

🎯 My goal? To become an AI Engineer at NVIDIA and push the boundaries of what's possible with technology!

🌱 Currently learning: C, Python, Data Analysis, and AI Concepts.

"🔍 Fun Fact: I love solving complex problems but somehow still get excited when a simple 'Hello, World!' prints successfully! 😄
