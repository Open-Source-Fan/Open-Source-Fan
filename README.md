Hi, I’m @Open-Source-Fan
I’m interested in Cyber Security
I’m currently Preparing for my Comptia Security + certification 
I’m looking for a better future in Cyber Security 
Fun fact: I am a 16-year-old male and a tech enthusiast. Whenever I learn a practical skill, I upload it to my GitHub repository. This motivates and encourages me to learn more.
